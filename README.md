# Kickstarter App
This is the main project in [Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/). 

## Introduction
In the traditional Kickstarter system, a manager proposes a project and asks for funds from the publicâ€”people around the world pay this manager directly into a currency. 

After that, the manager is supposed to create the product, as proposed and provide benefits to users. But there is nothing in the world stopping the manager from not doing that and running away with all of the money.

Using the ethereum blockchain network makes it possible to create an application that can solve this trust problem.

The app is supposed to serve as an interaction between managers and the contributors where the manager cannot just run with all of the money and needs permission from contributors on how he/she want to spend the funds.

It empowers the contributors and stops many scammers from doing these scams on a traditional Kickstarter platform.
